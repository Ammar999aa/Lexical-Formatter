# Lexical-Formatter

The Lexical Formattor is a program created to help users organize the dictionary of user constructed languages.

# What the program currently does

- Add verbs, nouns, adjectives, and adverbs to a database.
- Verbs have a builtin theta grid which a user can add.
- Nouns, adjectives, and adverbs can be derived from verbs, nouns, and adjectives respectively.
- Derived words are conncted with their roots and vice versa.
- Use a random word generator to create a random root.
- Enter a seed to consisently get the same random roots in a given order.
- Format words into a dictionary. This shows the words as entries with accompanying data, such as lexical category, translation, potential theta grid, root, and devirations.
- Generate compact text that the user can store before exiting the program.
- Load text from previous functionality into the system when user logs back in to restore progress.

The program is under development and some of the processes have bugs that are under maintainance.
